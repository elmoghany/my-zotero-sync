Text-to-Image and Text-to-Video AI generation models are revolutionary technologies that use deep learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to create images and videos from textual descriptions. This paper investigates cutting-edge approaches in the discipline of Text-to-Image and Text-to-Video AI generations. The survey provides an overview of the existing literature as well as an analysis of the approaches used in various studies. It covers data preprocessing techniques, neural network types, and evaluation metrics used in the field. In addition, the paper discusses the challenges and limitations of Text-to-Image and Text-to-Video AI generations, as well as future research directions. Overall, these models have promising potential for a wide range of applications such as video production, content creation, and digital marketing.
