We introduce Open-Sora Plan, an open-source project that aims to contribute a large generation model for generating desired high-resolution videos with long durations based on various user inputs. Our project comprises multiple components for the entire video generation process, including a Wavelet-Flow Variational Autoencoder, a Joint Image-Video Skiparse Denoiser, and various condition controllers. Moreover, many assistant strategies for efficient training and inference are designed, and a multi-dimensional data curation pipeline is proposed for obtaining desired high-quality data. Benefiting from efficient thoughts, our Open-Sora Plan achieves impressive video generation results in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. We hope our careful design and practical experience can inspire the video generation research community. All our codes and model weights are publicly available at \url{this https URL}.
