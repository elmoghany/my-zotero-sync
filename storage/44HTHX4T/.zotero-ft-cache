Personalizing text-to-image models to generate images of specific subjects across diverse scenes and styles is a rapidly advancing field. Current approaches often face challenges in maintaining a balance between identity preservation and alignment with the input text prompt. Some methods rely on a single textual token to represent a subject, which limits expressiveness, while others employ richer representations but disrupt the model's prior, diminishing prompt alignment. In this work, we introduce Nested Attention, a novel mechanism that injects a rich and expressive image representation into the model's existing cross-attention layers. Our key idea is to generate query-dependent subject values, derived from nested attention layers that learn to select relevant subject features for each region in the generated image. We integrate these nested layers into an encoder-based personalization method, and show that they enable high identity preservation while adhering to input text prompts. Our approach is general and can be trained on various domains. Additionally, its prior preservation allows us to combine multiple personalized subjects from different domains in a single image.
