Text-to-video diffusion models have shown remarkable progress in generating coherent video clips from textual descriptions. However, the interplay between motion, structure, and identity representations in these models remains under-explored. Here, we investigate how self-attention query features (a.k.a. Q features) simultaneously govern motion, structure, and identity and examine the challenges arising when these representations interact. Our analysis reveals that Q affects not only layout, but that during denoising Q also has a strong effect on subject identity, making it hard to transfer motion without the side-effect of transferring identity. Understanding this dual role enabled us to control query feature injection (Q injection) and demonstrate two applications: (1) a zero-shot motion transfer method that is 20 times more efficient than existing approaches, and (2) a training-free technique for consistent multi-shot video generation, where characters maintain identity across multiple video shots while Q injection enhances motion fidelity.
